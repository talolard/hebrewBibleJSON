# Hebrew Bible in JSON
This repo has 
- The Hebrew Bible in html format in the **rawData** directory
- That data, as a JSON array of objects. Each object is one verse, has the verse content and info on the book and chapter
- A notebook we used to extract the verses. 

## Why 
We use this to test our [Text Annotation Tool](www.lighttag.io) which needs to support RTL. You can use it because it's cool.
